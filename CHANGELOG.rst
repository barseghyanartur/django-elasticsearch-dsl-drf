0.16
----
2018-09-10

.. note::

    This release contains minor backwards incompatible changes. You might
    need to update your code if you have been making use of nested search.

*Old way of declaring nested search fields*

.. code-block:: python

    search_nested_fields = {
        'country': ['name'],
        'country.city': ['name'],
    }

*New way of declaring nested search fields*

.. code-block:: python

    search_nested_fields = {
        'country': {
            'path': 'country',
            'fields': ['name'],
        },
        'city': {
            'path': 'country.city',
            'fields': ['name'],
        },
    }

- Changes in nested search. This affects usage of both historical
  ``SearchFilterBackend`` and ``CompoundSearchFilterBackend``. Update your code
  accordingly.
- Take meta property ``using`` of the document ``Meta`` into consideration.

0.15.1
------
2018-08-22

- More tests.

- Unified the base ``BaseSearchFilterBackend`` class.
- Minor clean up and fixes in docs.
- Upgrading test suite to modern versions (``pytest``, ``tox``,
  ``factory_boy``, ``Faker``). Removing unused dependencies from
  requirements (``drf-extensions``).
- Fixed missing PDF generation in offline documentation (non ReadTheDocs).
  The ``rst2pdf`` package (which does not support Python 3) has been replaced
  with ``rinohtype`` package (which does support Python 3).

0.13.1
------
2018-07-26

- Minor fix in suggesters on Elasticsearch 6.x.

0.13
----
2018-07-23

.. note::

    Release dedicated to Guido van Rossum, the former Python BDFL, who
    resigned from his BDFL position recently. Guido knew it better than we all
    do. His charisma, talent and leadership will be certainly missed a lot by
    the community. Thumbs up again for the best BDFL ever.

- The ``SimpleQueryStringSearchFilterBackend`` backend has been implemented.
- Minor fixes in the ``MultiMatchSearchFilterBackend`` backend.

0.12
----
2018-07-21

- New-style Search Filter Backends. Old style ``SearchFilterBackend`` is
  still supported (until at least version 0.16), but is deprecated. Migrate to
  ``CompoundSearchFilterBackend``. ``MultiMatchSearchFilterBackend``
  introduced (the name speaks for itself).
- From now on, your views would also work with model- and object-level
  permissions of the Django REST Framework (such as ``DjangoModelPermissions``,
  ``DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly`` and ``DjangoObjectPermissions``).
  Correspondent model or object would be used for that. If you find it
  incorrect in your case, write custom permissions and declare the explicitly
  in your view-sets.
- Fixed geo-spatial ``geo_distance`` ordering for Elastic 5.x. and 6.x.
- Fixes occasionally failing tests.

0.11
----
2018-07-15

.. note::

    This release contains backwards incompatible changes.
    You should update your Django code and front-end parts of your applications
    that were relying on the complex queries using ``|`` and ``:`` chars in the
    GET params.

.. note::

    If you have used custom filter backends using ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_VALUE``,
    ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_COMPLEX_VALUE`` or
    ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_COMPLEX_MULTIPLE_VALUE`` constants or
    ``split_lookup_complex_value`` helper method of the ``FilterBackendMixin``,
    you most likely want to run your functional tests to see if everything
    still works.

.. note::

    Do not keep things as they were in your own fork, since new search backends
    will use the ``|`` and ``:`` symbols differently.

**Examples of old API requests vs new API requests**

.. note::

    Note, that ``|`` and ``:`` chars were mostly replaced with ``__`` and ``,``.

*Old API requests*

.. code-block:: text

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/search/publisher/?search=name|reilly&search=city|london

- ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_VALUE`` has been removed. Use
  ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_COMPLEX_VALUE`` and
  ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_COMPLEX_MULTIPLE_VALUE`` instead.
- ``SEPARATOR_LOOKUP_NAME`` has been added.
- The method ``split_lookup_complex_value`` has been removed. Use
  ``split_lookup_complex_value`` instead.
- Default filter lookup option is added. In past, if no specific lookup was
  provided and there were multiple values for a single field to filter on, by
  default ``terms`` filter was used. The ``term`` lookup was used by default
  in similar situation for a single value to filter on. It's now possible to
  declare default lookup which will be used when no lookup is given.
- Removed deprecated ``views`` module. Import from ``viewsets`` instead.
- Removed undocumented ``get_count`` helper from ``helpers`` module.

---
2018-06-01

.. note::

    Release supported by `Goldmund, Wyldebeast & Wunderliebe
    <https://goldmund-wyldebeast-wunderliebe.nl/>`_.

.. note::

    This release contain minor backwards incompatible changes. You should
    update your code.

    - (1) ``BaseDocumentViewSet`` (which from now on does not contain
          ``suggest`` functionality) has been renamed to ``DocumentViewSet``
          (which does contain ``suggest`` functionality).
    - (2) You should no longer import from
          ``django_elasticsearch_dsl_drf.views``. Instead, import from
          ``django_elasticsearch_dsl_drf.viewsets``.

- Deprecated ``django_elasticsearch_dsl_drf.views`` in favour
  of ``django_elasticsearch_dsl_drf.viewsets``.
- Suggest action/method has been moved to ``SuggestMixin`` class.
- ``FunctionalSuggestMixin`` class introduced which resembled functionality
  of the ``SuggestMixin`` with several improvements/additions, such as
  advanced filtering and context-aware suggestions.

  be used if you do not provide suffix for the filter name.

- Documentation fixes.

0.5
---
2017-10-05

.. note::

    This release contains changes that might be backwards incompatible
    for your project. If you have used dynamic document serializer
    ``django_elasticsearch_dsl_drf.serializers.DocumentSerializer``
    with customisations (with use of ``serializers.SerializerMethodField``,
    having the value parsed to JSON), just remove the custom parts.

- Support for ``ObjectField``, ``NestedField``, ``GeoPointField``,
  ``ListField``, ``GeoShapeField`` (and in general, nesting fields either
  as a dictionary or list should not be a problem at all).
- Dynamic serializer has been made less strict.
- Added ``get_paginated_response_context`` methods to both
  ``PageNumberPagination`` and ``LimitOffsetPagination`` pagination classes
  to simplify customisations.

---
2017-09-26

.. note::

    This release contains changes that might be backwards incompatible
    for your project. Make sure to add the ``DefaultOrderingFilterBackend``
    everywhere you have used the ``OrderingFilterBackend``, right after the
    latter.

- ``GeoSpatialFilteringFilterBackend`` filtering backend, supporting
  ``geo_distance`` and ``geo_polygon`` geo-spatial queries.
- ``GeoSpatialOrderingFilterBackend`` ordering backend, supporting
  ordering of results for ``geo_distance`` filter.
- ``OrderingFilterBackend`` no longer provides defaults when no ordering is
  given. In order to take care of the defaults include the
  ``DefaultOrderingFilterBackend`` in the list of ``filter_backends`` (after
  all other ordering backends).

0.3.12
------
2017-09-21

- Added ``geo_distance`` filter. Note, that although functionally the filter
  would not change its' behaviour, it is likely to be moved to a separate
  backend (``geo_spatial``). For now use as is.
